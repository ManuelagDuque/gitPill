* Improve the quality of the data;
* Extract and collect / obtain new structured and unstructured text data (knowledge extraction through text mining);
* Enrich and update existing data;
* Carry out semantic searches;
* Get reports and visualizations of the query results, as this will also help to reuse and understand the data;
* Identify potential relationships between entities;
* Maintain, improve and update vocabularies when new needs are detected.


This repository contains the main functionalities and deliverables related to semantic development and the content is organized in a general structure of 3 folders like this:

* dev ---> development related files.
* gov ---> files related to the governance of the project.
